                        <h4>Virtualization</h4>
                        <p>Organizations cannot afford not to virtualize their environment if they don’t want to risk having more business disruptions, more complex IT environments and unnecessarily high cost as most servers operate at less than 15 percent of capacity.</p>

                        <p>VMware, a global leader in virtualization and cloud infrastructure addresses these inefficiencies by allowing businesses to run more than one virtual system, multiple operating systems and applications on a single physical server as virtual machines, each with access to the underlying server's computing resources. Organizations can also evolve toward a fully virtualized software-defined data center architecture: virtualize networking, storage and security.</p>

                        <p>At Pufferfish Technologies, we provide virtualization solutions from VMWare and professional services, harnessing the skills and expertise of our people to help organizations design, provision and manage their virtual environments (server, network, desktop, cloud) thereby improving their overall efficiency at reduces cost, enabling faster workload deployment, increased application performance, and higher availability.</p>
