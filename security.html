                            <p>
                                Modern enterprise applications have transformed and improved the ways companies do business by being able to cater for a wider audience but have also left data stores more exposed to security breaches. Most companies, irrespective of function or geography, are subject to repeated attacks by hackers seeking to acquire their valuable data.
                                
                                Moreover the types and amount of information organizations now collect and store is skyrocketing and often it is unknown where critical information resides, who can access it, when they can access it or what happens once it’s accessed. IBM® Security Guardium offers a comprehensive data security platform that provides a full range of capabilities that can help organizations to:
                                
                                • Prevent data breaches, insider risk and fraud, and unauthorized changes to (or destruction of) sensitive data
                                
                                • 100% visibility into all database transactions – across all platforms and protocols – including those of DBAs, developers and outsourced personnel.
                                
                                • Centralized aggregation and normalization of audit data from across your database infrastructure for enterprise-wide compliance auditing and reporting, correlation, and forensics.
                                
                                • A secure, tamper-proof audit trail that supports the separation of duties (SOD) required by auditors</p>

                            <p>IBM® Security identity and access management solutions help protect and monitor user access in multi-perimeter environments with context-based access control, security policy enforcement and business-driven identity governance. By integrating proven technologies with a layer of security intelligence, organizations can ensure that the right users have access to the right information in a timely manner. The solution centralizes and automates the management of users, providing industry-leading capabilities for assigning and enforcing user access rights, monitoring user activity and for detecting and escalating activities that are non-compliant with an organization’s security policy.</p>

                            <p>Email continues to be the primary way cyber criminals infiltrate an enterprise. 90% of cyberattacks and data breaches involve spear phishing. 100% of spear phishing attacks involve identity deception. Existing solutions are failing to protect organizations from targeted email attacks, spear phishing and business email compromise.</p>
                                
                            <p>Blocking email based on content does not work for, you need to know the ‘true’ identity of an email’s sender. Pufferfish provides businesses with a comprehensive approach to identifying targeted email attacks and blocking spear phishing attacks for your cloud or on-premise email solutions.</p>

                            <p>Each device that connects to the your network must be adequately secured to prevent breaches and the loss of sensitive data.</p>
                                
                            <p>With the continuous adoption of mobile devices into work environments, the task of securing various both employee and organization owned endpoints can be daunting for any size business to say the least. You will need the smartest endpoint protection platform on the planet to increase operational efficiency, maximize data security and deliver on your digital transformation goals. Fortinet, Checkpoint etc. delivers cognitive insights, contextual analytics, and cloud-sourced benchmarking capabilities to make sense of the mobile minutiae you encounter daily – while protecting your endpoints, users, apps, docs, and their data from one platform.</p>
                                
                            <p>IBM® BigFix® is an endpoint security and management platform that provides real-time visibility and control across endpoints wherever they are connected. This is used to addresses a major challenge faced by many organizations — how to gain full visibility into the constantly changing endpoint landscape while bridging the gap between threat detection and remediation.</p>

                            <p><strong>Fortinet Endpoint Overview</strong> <br> are frequently the target of initial compromise or attacks. One recent study found that 30% of breaches involved malware being installed on endpoints. FortiClient strengthens endpoint security through integrated visibility, control, and proactive defense. With the ability to discover, monitor, and assess endpoint risks, you can ensure endpoint compliance, mitigate risks, and reduce exposure. FortiClient proactively defends against advanced attacks. Its tight integration with the Security Fabric enables policy-based automation to contain threats and control outbreaks. FortiClient is compatible with Fabric-Ready partners to further strengthen enterprises’ security posture.</p>

                            <p>Network Access Control (NAC) is a type of Cyber Security technology that allows an organization to define and implement policies that control the access of endpoints to a network; while at the same time providing visibility of each device trying to access. NAC provides security posture assessments for the endpoints, highlighting the risks, and can control access based on the level of risk tolerated by the organization.</p>
                                
                            <p>Portnox Network Access Control (NAC) is a light-weight solution delivered from the cloud (as-a-service) or from an on-premises centralized software, providing agentless visibility into every endpoint ON or OFF the enterprise premises, whether it is IoT, BYOD or a company managed device.</p>
